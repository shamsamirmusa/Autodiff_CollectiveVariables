    "# The PYCV module for PLUMED 2 Tutorial\n",
    "## Objective  \n",
    "This tutorial guides you step by step through setting up and using Pycv interface for PLUMED. It allows users to define custom collective variables in Pyhton and interface them with PLUMED's engine. No c++ coding is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:\n",
    "* Install PLUMED with Pycv support.\n",
    "* Define Differentiable CVs in Python.\n",
    "* Link the CV to plumed.\n",
    "* Run the CV through the plumed Driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instalation \n",
    "### Prerequisites  \n",
    "The following installation is based a MacOS. \n",
    "The virtual environment is set using python3 venv.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation  \n",
    "Create a working directory, for example, `/my_directory` then \n",
    "1. Clone the plumed source code (version 2.10)  \n",
    "\n",
    "    `git clone --branch 2.10 https://github.com/plumed/plumed2.git`  \n",
    "    \n",
    "At the end of the clonning, you shall find a `plumed2` directory  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create and activate a Python environment:  \n",
    "for example  \n",
    "\n",
    "    `pyhton3 -m venv pycvenv`  \n",
    "    `source pycvenv/bin/activate`  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Configuration  \n",
    "Make sure you are in the  `plumed2` directory  \n",
    "\n",
    "    `./configure`  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Compilation  \n",
    "\n",
    "    `make -j4`  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Source the PLUMED environment script  \n",
    "This step sets up environment variables needed to use PLUMED  \n",
    "    `source sourceme.sh`  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Install Python dependenciies and the PyCV interface.  \n",
    "Navigate to the plugin directory  \n",
    "\n",
    "    `cd plugin/pycv`  \n",
    "    `pip install -r requirements.txt`  \n",
    "    `pip install .`  \n",
    "\n",
    "This concludes the installation procedure. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Uasge  \n",
    "When wanting to use your PyCV enabled PLUMED, the environment variables explained below must be set in the same shell session where you execute the PLUMED driver.  \n",
    "This is typically the terminal where your Python CV file and PLUMED input file reside and where you run the plumed driver command.  \n",
    "Otherwise, PLUMED will not find the shared library or your Python module.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Activate your virtual environment  \n",
    "    `source /../../my_directory/pycvenv/bin/activate`  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Source the PLUMED shell environment  \n",
    "    `source /../../my_directory/plumed2/sourceme.sh`  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Export your virtual environemnt `site-packages` to `PYTHONPATH`:  \n",
    "Find the virtual environment `site-packages` path (example below uses Pyhton 3.10):  \n",
    "    `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/../../my_directory/pycvenv/lib/python3.10/site-packages`  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Locate the shared dynamic library `PythonCVInterface`:  \n",
    "This will be used in the plumed input file for plumed to interpret and execute the Pyhton based CV.     \n",
